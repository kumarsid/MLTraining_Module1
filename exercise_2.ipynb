You should be completing this when prompted by the trainer as Exercise 3 of the session.  You should read each task, and then try to write code to achieve what you are being asked in the code cell below each set of instructions.  Remember - check your code is working by running the code cell (CTRL + Enter whilst in the cell, or click the play button to the left of the cell)."

    "**Task 3** The code cell below contains an import of the random library - you'll learn more about this later, but basically an import allows us to import code that other people have written - in this case, code that allows us to randomly select numbers.  It also contains a line of code that shows you how to use the random library to randomly select an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive) and store the result in a variable.  Add to this code cell, by storing a variable named number_of_fives that is initially set to 0 and will act as a counter.  Then, get the computer to keep randomly selecting a number between 1 and 10, printing the number it picks, and checking whether the number is a 5.  If it is a 5, it prints an additional message saying it has found a 5, and increases the counter you set up above by 1.  The computer should keep doing this until it finds five 5s, at which point it will declare that \"Johnny Five is Alive!\" and the code will end."
